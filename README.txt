Simple to setup via uPnP discovery to locate your Sky Q boxes when adding devices.

Enables flows to switch your Sky Q into the standby by state when you go out or go to bed.

The feedback of the standby state along with the Switched on / off trigger (WHEN) cards means you can detect when the Sky Q box is turned on or put into standby with the remote control.
So you can now switch off your Homey compatible TV when you put the Sky Q box into standby or close the curtains and dim the lights when you turn it on.

You can also change the channel Up and Down with buttons or flow action (THEN) cards
